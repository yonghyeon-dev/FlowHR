# WI-0773 Admin Onboarding Contract Approval Request Coverage

## Summary
- extended `/admin/onboarding` contract section with approval-request coverage metrics.
- onboarding setup now derives contract approval-request coverage from employment template documents.
- added one-click pending approval request action:
  - targets pending `DRAFT` employment contract documents,
  - calls `POST /api/contracts/documents/{documentId}/request-approval` per pending item,
  - refreshes setup coverage after completion.

## Scope
- core onboarding journey enhancement only
- no scheduler/ops expansion
- no phase-style layering

## Data Changes
