# WI-0775 Admin Onboarding Contract Send Execution Coverage

## Summary
- extended `/admin/onboarding` contract section with send-execution coverage metrics.
- onboarding setup now derives send-ready/pending coverage from approval-completed employment contract documents.
- added one-click pending send action:
  - targets pending `DRAFT` onboarding contract documents with `approvalStatus=APPROVED`,
  - calls `POST /api/contracts/documents/{documentId}/send`,
  - refreshes coverage after execution.

## Scope
- core onboarding journey enhancement only
- no scheduler/ops expansion
- no phase-style layering

## Data Changes
- none
